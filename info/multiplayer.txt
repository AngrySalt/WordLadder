You can disable multiplayer by setting the "multiplayer" bool to false.
When multiplayer is enabled, anyone can reply to the bot to get the answer.
Otherwise, only the person who started the Word Ladder can reply.
This may be useful for preventing trolls from getting you off the path to your goal word.

In multiplayer, all score goes to the person who created the game.
So if you're trying to boost your own scores, make sure to create your own game.
