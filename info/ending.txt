There are 3 manual ways to end a word ladder:
1: Using "/wordladder end" will end your current word ladder.
2: Reacting "‚ùå" to a message from a word ladder you started will end that ladder.
3: Administrators deleting a message from a word ladder will end it.
A word ladder can also end automatically if:
1: You reach your target word
2: There are no replies for over 3 minutes
