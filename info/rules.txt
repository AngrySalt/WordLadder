The goal of word ladder differs depending on whether or not you choose a winning word.
In endless, there is no winning word, so the goal is to just find as many "chain" words as possible.
Otherwise, the goal is to get from the beginning word to the end word.
For info on what "chain" words are valid, use "/info chains"
